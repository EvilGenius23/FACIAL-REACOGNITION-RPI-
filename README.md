# FACIAL-REACOGNITION-RPI-
# PRI PROJECTS 2020
For Raspberry Pi facial recognition, we’ll utilize OpenCV, face_recognition, and imutils packages to train our Raspberry Pi 
based on a set of images that we collect and provide as our dataset. We’ll run train_model.py to analyze the images in our dataset and create a mapping between names and faces 
in the file
After we finish training our Pi, we’ll run facial_req.py to detect and identify faces.
We’ve also included additional code to trigger an email to yourself when a face is recognized.
